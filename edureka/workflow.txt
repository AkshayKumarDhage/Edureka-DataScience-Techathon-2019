1. Given Dataset consists of 3390 data rows and total of 18 features.

   Independent Features:  	car_company 	model_ID 	mileage 	engine_power 		registration_date 	fuel 	car_paint_color 	car_type 	feature1 		feature2 	feature3 	feature4 	feature5 	feature6 	feature7 		feature8 	sold_date 	
	
   Target Feature: car_price

2. Data Types of variables: 
	dtypes: bool(8), int64(3), object(7)

3. Conversion of object/Categorical Data Type to Numerical Data Type:
	i. Using One_Hot_Encoding:
		By performing One_Hot_Encoding on variables we convert it to Binary Vectors.
		One_Hot_Encoding is performed on 'car_company', 'fuel', 'car_type' in given dataset.
       ii. Using Label_Encoding:
		By performing Label_Encoding on variables we assing labels ranging between 0 to n-1 where n is the n is number of distinct Labels.
		Label_Encoding is performed on 'model_ID' and 'car_paint_color' in given dataset.

4. Conversion of Date type values:
	Since we have 'registration_date' and 'sold_date' we can calculate Number of 'used_days'.

5. Handling Missing Values:
	Since the given dataset doesn't contain any NULL or missing values, this step is skipped.

6. Exploratory Data Analysis:
	i. In this the car_prices for all cars in given dataset is visualised.
       ii. Correlation among various features/variables with respect to Target variable is visualisted using Cross Matrix.
      iii. Histograms for visualising values for all the feature Variables.

**Now our data is ready to feed it to Machine Learning Model**

7. Machine Learning Model development: 
	i. Since we need to predict Car_Price for given input, it is a continuous data prediction hence we can use "Supervised Learning", So "Multiple Regression Machine Learning Model" should be fine.
       ii. Seperating Data into Train set for training ML model, and test set for testing our trained model as X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
      iii. Using sklearn Library for Linear Regression Model, and train ML model on X_train, y_train.
       iv. Now, after traing our regressor ML model, we can use it for prediction on X_test, and store prediction in y_pred.

8. Summary of Machine Learning Model.
	i. This shows the values of coefficients, r2_score and other statistical information.
